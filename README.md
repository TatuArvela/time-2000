## Actual README

* Sakura Time 2000 is meant to be a honoring tribute to late 90s Microsoft Windows and Office applications. I created this mildly useful little application as a CSS, JS and pixel graphics learning practice.
* The graphics of the application are property of Microsoft Corporation, where applicable. This is not an actual commercial software product. The made-up name Sakura does not refer to any real-life company.
* Supported browsers are the latest and greatest versions of Chrome and Firefox. Ironically, Sakura Time 2000 is not fully compatible with Microsoft Internet Explorer or Edge.
